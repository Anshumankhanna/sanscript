# Sanscript

The name of the language has two meanings that signify its nature and purpose:
- "sans" "script" breakdown roughly translated in french gives us without script i.e. this language may look and feel like scripting language and perform tasks but it will be very distinct from the general scripting languages.
- It is also a play on the phonetics sounding like "Sanskrit" a language famous for precisness in vocabulary.

## What can it do?

Currently the language has just birthed and as I learn more about languages it will get more new features.\
As of now it is a general scripting language that is based on typescript.\
In future, it will get more features and this won't be an interpreter, rather a compiler.

## How can we use it now?

A full documentation will be rolled out in time.
